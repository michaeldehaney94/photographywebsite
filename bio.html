            <h3>My Story</h3>
            <div class="about">
                <p>I was born and raised in the rural parish of Eastern Saint Thomas, Jamaica W.I. in 1994,
                    where I was influenced to have an appreciation for agriculture, nature and culture during my early years. 
                    In 2011, at the age of 17, I gained an interest in photography while going on vacation to Montego Bay,
                    St. James. On the way to Montego Bay, I used my first Sony 8 Megapixel camera, to takes scenic
                    photos in the town of Kingston, Bog Walk, Ocho Rios, Lilliput and Falmouth as memorabilia.
                    In 2013 at the age of 19, I enrolled in a photography class at the Edna Manley College of Visual and
                    Performing Arts to gain more experience and knowledge in digital photography. During my time at the Edna 
                    Manley College, I was force to expand curiosity in photography and explore topics, as such, 'people within society'
                    when I did a photoshoot in Crossroads, Kingston and 'history' when I went to the historic village of Port Royal for an
                    photojournalism project. Exploring these topics of 'people within society' and 'history' made me have a better understanding
                    of how individuals lived, how people interact within an environment and how nature takes a course of it's own.
